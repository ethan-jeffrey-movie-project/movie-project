tmdb api: provides movies to the user
rotten tomatoes api: ratings

overview:

Create two forms:

Form 1: My Favorites - displays data from the JSON file and allows users to perform CRUD operations on it ( edit,  rate).

Form 2: Discover Movies - displays movies from TMDB that the user can scroll through
when they reach the end make a new fetch

and search for specific movies.
- fix the initial search, you'll get a warning the first time
- when the search button is entered or pressed,
hide the movie genres,
- when the user is searching for a movie, show the possible movies that they could select

Whenever the user searches for a specific movie in Form 2,
You can then compare the movie ID to the IDs in your JSON file to see if the movie is already in your favorites.

Whenever a user rates a movie,
the rating data can be saved to the JSON file.
This way, the user can see their rating in Form 1 and it will also be displayed in Form 2.

reload , fill the input form with my selection , i get this warning,"form submission canceled because the form is not connected",
input clears, fill the input form with my selection again , i can see the fetch request in the console along with what i wanted to search for

fix scrolling whenever a user searches
